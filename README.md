## Objectives
- Develop an understanding of integrating public APIs into web projects.
- Gain practical experience in server-side programming using Express/Node.js.
- Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.
- Demonstrate the ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.

## Used APIs

## Requirements
1. **API Choice**: Choose an API from the provided list that is suitable for retrieving, manipulating, and presenting data in a meaningful and interactive way.
2. **Project Planning**: Research the chosen API, its features, and how it will be integrated into the web application.
3. **Project Setup**: Set up a new Node.js project using Express.js, including Axios for HTTP requests and EJS for templating. Ensure structured directory and file organization.
4. **API Integration**: Implement at least a GET endpoint to interact with the chosen API using Axios for HTTP requests.
5. **Data Presentation**: Design the application to present retrieved data in a user-friendly manner using HTML, CSS, and EJS templating.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for both the application and API requests to provide meaningful feedback to users.
7. **Documentation**: Include comments throughout the code to explain logic and create a Readme.md file explaining how to start the server and run the code.
8. **Code Sharing**: Share the project on GitHub for collaboration and feedback.
